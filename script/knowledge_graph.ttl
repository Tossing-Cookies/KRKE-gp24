Cardwell's definition of a stereotype as "a fixed, often simplistic generalization about a particular group or class of people. [...] These stereotypes are often negative and unflattering, and may underly prejudice and discrimination". In our ontology, the Stereotype class encapsulates the generalized beliefs and oversimplified notions frequently attributed to members of specific subcultures. These stereotypes reflect societal perceptions and can shape mainstream discourse, influencing how subcultures are understood and portrayed. By capturing these stereotypes, the class facilitates the analysis of misrepresentations and biases that may skew public perception, offering insights into the disparity between societal views of subcultures and their actual characteristics and values.\r
